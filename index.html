            We had been upgraded to an ocean view villa (this is a one category
            upgrade over the base room, which is a garden view villa), #205. It
            seemed to me like our villa was especially secluded, as there were
            no other villas anywhere in the area. WOW, this villa was beautiful.
            There was a gate and then a path leading into the villa’s outdoor
            area.

          <p>
            We were spending eight days in the Seychelles, and when we booked
            this trip many months ago, we initially booked five nights at the
            Four Seasons Desroches Island, which was going to be the “highlight”
            of our trip. I’ll talk more about that booking process when I review
            that hotel, but we booked a (publicly available) pre-opening rate
            there.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="fourth">
          <p>
            For our three nights on Mahe Island (the main island in the
            Seychelles) we didn’t know where we wanted to stay. At first we were
            going to stay at the Le Meridien Fisherman’s Cove, but Tiffany had a
            not-great experience there. She said the Hilton Seychelles Northolme
            was much better, so we were looking at that. However, the rate was
            around 500EUR for our dates, and since Tiffany will (hopefully) be
            reviewing that soon, I figured we should try something else.

            Our flight from Paris arrived at around 10AM. Initially we were
            planning on renting a car while in the Seychelles, but due to some
            issues we ended up taking a taxi instead.

            Now let’s take a look at food at the resort. Breakfast is included
            for all guests at the Four Seasons, and is served daily at ZEZ
            Restaurant, from 7AM until 10:30AM. ZEZ Restaurant was located near
            the center of the resort, a few flights of stairs down from
            reception.
